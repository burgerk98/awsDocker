# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

@@@@ 알게된 사실
도커 이미지를 빌드하고 컨테이너를 실행한 후에는 로컬 시스템에서 npm run start명령이 아닌
docker run -p 3000:3000 sha256:c1ef1a065ad624b8a5f5806febc563c10fbdf710d208de05dfbd71b2d182846a
를 사용해야한다.

하지만 매번 길게 치거나 아이디를 찾기엔 헷갈리니
alias docker-start="docker run -p 3000:3000 sha256:c1ef1a065ad624b8a5f5806febc563c10fbdf710d208de05dfbd71b2d182846a
와 같이 alias로 별칭을 지정해 원하는대로 설정해 사용할 수 있다.

그 외에는 도커컴포즈, 스크립트작성, 도커 이미지 이름 설정 등이 있는데,,. 나에게는 별칭 설정 정도가 맞는 것 같다..
